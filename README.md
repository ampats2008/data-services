# Data Services Website Project

This is a demo version of my client's Data Services website. Our team of 5 students was tasked with building the "Home" page and the "Web Services" section of the site. The other sections of the site ("Data Flow Diagrams" and "Data Dictionaries") are going to be developed by other teams, so they are not included in this demo. <br>

We built the site using SharePoint 2013; SharePoint Custom Lists were used as the backend for storing program data. jQuery / AJAX / CAML Queries were used for retrieving data and presenting it on the site. The following changes have been made for the purposes of this demo version:<br>
  <li> *.aspx pages have been converted to static *.html templates </li>
  <li> JS has been moved from external scripts to inline <script> for the purposes of this demo. </li>
  <li> Internal client data has been replaced with dummy sample data. However, the logic presented in the JS 
  remains unchanged from the full version. </li>
