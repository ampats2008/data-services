# Data Services Website Project

This is a demo version of my client's Data Services web application. The full version was built using SharePoint 2013; SharePoint Custom Lists were used as the backend for storing program data. jQuery / AJAX / CAML Queries were used for retrieving data and presenting it on the site. The following changes have been made for the purposes of this demo version:<br>
  <li> *.aspx pages have been converted to static *.html templates </li>
  <li> JS has been moved from external scripts to inline <script> for the purposes of this demo. </li>
  <li> Internal client data has been replaced with dummy sample data. However, the logic presented in the JS 
  remains unchanged from the full version. </li>
